# THEMES FOR NEOWOLF

## Generic instructions

- Save the "layout" files in the Layouts section of Neowolf's admin, with Content-Type set to `text/html`.
- Theme names should (normally!) be identical to their folder name in this repo.
- Upload the css (and js) files to your site using the Files > themes > \[theme-name\] uploader in Neowolf.
- Themes should now be available to be set site-wide or on a per-page basis in the Pages > Edit page > settings tab.

## Available themes

There is a basic, functional layout for each of four different "frameworks", identified in the folder name. For further development, consult the documentation for that particular framework:

- [Bulma](https://bulma.io/documentation/)
- [Mui](https://www.muicss.com/)
- [Picnic](https://picnicss.com/documentation)
- [Pure](https://purecss.io/)
